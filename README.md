semanticversion is a [NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semanticversion) and command line tool that helps you easily change your semantic version in your `package.json` file and push the tag to git.


## Installation
Install globally by running `npm install semanticversion -g`.

## Usage

While in your project root (where `package.json` is located), access the tool by running either `updateTag` or `semanticversion`.

Then you will be asked a series of questions that will help you easily publish your tags.
